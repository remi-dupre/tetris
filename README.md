# TetRS

A Tetris game, written in Rust with the [Bevy][bevy] engine.

This is a toy project which is only meant as an exercise to learn the basics of
the Bevy engine and experiment with ECS. From a developer point of view the
whole project may seem weird as ECS seems a bit overkill for a Tetris
implementation.

I'm not a Tetris player, so I based the game on community documentation, mostly
the official guidelines and Fandom's wiki:

- https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_Guideline
- https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki

## License

I'm pretty sure all this work belongs to [the Tetris Company][tetris-company]
